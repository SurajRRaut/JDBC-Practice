# JDBC Practice Project

Welcome to the JDBC Practice Project repository! This project is designed to help you practice and enhance your skills in Java Database Connectivity (JDBC), a powerful API for connecting and interacting with relational databases using Java.

## Project Overview

This practice project focuses on developing a simple Java application that demonstrates various JDBC operations, including establishing database connections, executing SQL queries, and performing database CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
